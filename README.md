# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`at first, he said he accepts his girlfriend is a single mom, then he realized he couldn't then he betrayed his girlfriend. When her girlfriend saw a woman called him on a video call. he was lying to her that was his high school friends. and she gonna get marry~~!!! woo.. his girlfriend trusted him. then nowaday she finally finds out all of his lies~
that girl he met on his Twitter randomly~ and just affair with her.
now everyone knows this guy is a cheater
and he also said a lot about his mother~ he is just a two-faced man
for those years from 2017 to 2020, his girlfriend trusted him n fly to Belgium for him many times but in the end, he is cheating and he still blames his girlfriend because she is a single mother. and even though he knew how his girlfriend has been through~ he is doing the same~ and whenever they have argued, he puts the girl past to abuse 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
